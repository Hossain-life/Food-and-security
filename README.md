# Food-and-security

There are many people in United States who are below poverty line. The purpose of this app is to take money from the donor, and the restaurant will receive the money and then distribute food 
among the needy people. One of the apps in our application is UBF which handles all the transaction between donors and restaurants, and this app is also responsible for feeding food
to the needy people. So I have created a data model for UBF using amazon dynamodb. There are 7 tables in the data model. First is donor, second is transaction, and the third is
recipient followed by restaurant, ratings, meal and order. In my model, needy people can see the location of the restaurants and can order the food accordingly. He/she can also rate the
restaurant and their meals. Also, donors can choose where to pay the amount for the needy people. At last, we can also see the recipients who ordered the meals and can view the prices
of their ordered items.
